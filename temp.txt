Random number generator seed: 2765076182065916372

Simulations of 10 taxa, 40 nucleotides
  for 1 tree(s) with 1 dataset(s) per tree

Branch lengths assumed to be number of substitutions per site

Rate homogeneity of sites.
Model = GTR: General time reversible (nucleotides)
  Rate of transitions and transversions equal:
  rate matrix = gamma1: 0.5000 alpha1: 0.5000  beta1: 0.5000
                                beta2: 0.5000 alpha2: 0.5000
                                              gamma2:  1.0000
  with nucleotide frequencies equal.
